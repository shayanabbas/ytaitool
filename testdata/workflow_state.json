    "script": "Title: The Whispering Witch of Willow Creek\n\n[Scene 1: A dimly-lit bedroom, night. Toys scattered around, a small figure is seen huddling under the covers.]\n\nNARRATOR: In the heart of a silent night, young Airah felt an unnerving chill creep into her cozy room.\n\n[AIRAH shivers, pulling the blanket closer]\n\nAIRAH: (whispering) It's just the wind.\n\n[SFX: Soft, eerie whispering outside the window]\n\n[Scene 2: Close-up on the window, curtains fluttering. The moon casts a ghostly glow.]\n\nNARRATOR: But the whispering winds carried a voice, a voice that knew her name.\n\n[SFX: Wind howling, mixed with a faint, sinister laugh]\n\nWITCH: (whispering) Airaaah...\n\n[AIRAH's eyes widen in fear.]\n\n[Scene 3: AIRAH, driven by curiosity and fear, approaches the window. She peeks outside.]\n\nNARRATOR: Mustering all her courage, Airah dared to look upon the source of the whispers.\n\n[Outside, a shadowy figure stands by the Willow tree, eyes glowing softly.]\n\nWITCH: Come out, little one...\n\n[AIRAH gasps, stepping back.]\n\n[Scene 4: The room suddenly grows colder. Objects begin to subtly move.]\n\nNARRATOR: The witch's magic seeped through the cracks, chilling the air, stirring the shadows.\n\n[SFX: Objects clattering softly]\n\nAIRAH: (scared) You can't come in!\n\nWITCH: (taunting) But you can come out...\n\n[Scene 5: Focus on AIRAH, torn between staying safe and confronting the witch. She grabs a flashlight.]\n\nNARRATOR: Armed with nothing but a flashlight and her wits, Airah made a choice.\n\n[AIRAH slowly opens the window, the cold night air rushes in.]\n\n[Scene 6: AIRAH steps outside, flashlight piercing the darkness. The WITCH's shadow looms large before her.]\n\nNARRATOR: Face to face with the whispering witch of Willow Creek, Airah stood her ground.\n\n[SFX: Heartbeat, increasing in speed]\n\nWITCH: Ah, brave child... let's see if your courage holds in the world of shadows.\n\n[A flash of light, and then darkness.]\n\nNARRATOR: And with a blinding flash, Airah was gone... into the night, leaving behind only the echo of her bravery.\n\n[SFX: Sudden silence, then a soft, eerie whisper fades out]\n\n[End with a still shot of the empty yard, the Willow tree swaying gently.]\n\nNARRATOR: What became of young Airah, you ask? Well, that's a story for another night.\n\n[Screen fades to black]",
